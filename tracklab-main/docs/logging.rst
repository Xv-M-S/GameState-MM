Logging
=======

The framework supports multi-level logging. It is possible to change the verbosity level by changing the ``logging_level`` in the ``main.py`` file.

Online logging is also available with `wandb <https://wandb.ai/>`_. You can disable this feature by changing the ``use_wandb`` variable in the main ``configs/config.yaml`` configuration file.
